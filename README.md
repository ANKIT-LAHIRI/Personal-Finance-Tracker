# Personal Finance Tracker

Simple full-stack project built with Java Spring Boot (backend) and a minimal HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS frontend.

## Run locally
1. Install JDK 17 and Maven.
2. In project root: `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser (or serve it with a static server).

Backend runs on http://localhost:8080 and exposes REST endpoints at `/api/transactions`.
